Project Overview

In this project, I explored why customers leave by analyzing a dataset of 3,000+ customer records. The dataset included details like their plans, call usage, and whether they churned or stayed. The goal was to uncover patterns that could help reduce churn.
Performed data cleaning, data manipulation
Used pivot table to get a clear picture of usage patterns and churn 
Created visualization in excel that make it easy it to analyse
